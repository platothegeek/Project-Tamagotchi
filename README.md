<h1>USER STORIES</h1>
<br>
1) When the start button is pressed I can name the tamagotchi and the game begins.
2) Every 20 seconds my Tamagochi ages until it reaches a maximum of 60, at which point it dies. If I was able to keep it alive up to this point an alert comes up congratulating me for winning and offering condolences for the lost pet.
3) As time goes on my Tamagochi's hunger, boredom, and tiredness worsen, but the exact time it takes varies between 2-10 seconds.
4) At age 20 and 40, my Tamagochi's animation changes to indicate ageing.
5) When I press the Feed, Sleep, or Play buttons it resets the respective counters to 0.

<h1>TECH USED</h1>
<br>
1) HTML 5
2) Javascipt 1.8
3) JQUERY
4) CSS3
<br>
<h1>APPROACH TAKEN</h1>
I took primarily an object oriented approach. I created the tamagochi as an object and had the rest of the code interact with the tama's variables and use those variables to update the HTML.
<br>
<h1>UNSOLVED PROBLEMS</h1>
<br>
Did not finish consolidating the functions which add to the hunger, age, tiredness, and boredom. I feel that I can consolidate it and use the variable I wish to add to as a parameter. Also the page occasionally still scrolls but far less than it used to.
